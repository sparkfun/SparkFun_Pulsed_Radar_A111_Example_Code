SDK Maintained by [Acconeer](https://developer.acconeer.com/)!
-------------------

Previously, this repo contained old version releases of the SDK for the A111. However, the folks over at Acconeer have agreed to host the latest version of their SDK with our example code from their website. Acconneer provides frequent software updates to the SDK packages to fix bugs and provide the latest features. Be sure to [visit Acconeer's "Developer" page](https://developer.acconeer.com/) on your Raspberry Pi's browser and download the latest SDK from Acconeer!
